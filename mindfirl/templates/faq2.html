Non-identifying information could include information such as diagnosis, medications, or blood pressure. This is the information that will help us answer our research question.">non-identifying information</a> only when we are using your health related data to learn more about science or medicine. We will use a software program called MINDFIRL (MINimum Necessary Disclosure For Interactive Record Linkage) to keep identifying information separate from non-identifying information and <b>ensure that no one can access identifying information and non-identifying information together at the same time. </b>(for MINDFIRL, see sections 2.2 & 2.3)<br><br>
							In many cases, patient matching is done entirely with a linkage software, like MINDFIRL, and <b>a human may never see your identifying information</b> because the computer is automatically matching patients without human effort. For others records where the computer is not sure, researchers must manually make the matches.<br><br> 
							<i>a.	Who will be able to see the <u>identifying information</u>?</i><br><br> 
							The researchers who will be doing the record matching will have access to identifying information. Information such as your name, date of birth, marital status, and gender help distinguish you from other people. Our researchers need to access identifying information to match patient records.<br><br> 
							We are using the MINDFIRL software (see section 2.2) to protect identifying information and prevent unnecessary privacy loss during this process. First, MINDFIRL separates identifying information from the non-identifying information. This means that, <b>no one can access the identifying information AND the health-related data at the same time.<br><br>
							Second, MINDFIRL tells researchers when two records have the same identifying information without showing details.</b> In these cases, our researchers might not need to see any specific identifying information to make a match.<br><br> 
							<b>MINDFIRL also tells researcher when records are highly similar without showing details.</b> MINDFIRL shows identifying information only on an ‘as needed’ basis. For example, a researcher might want to see some details to know if a difference is important (e.g, to tell twins apart). This means that MINDFIRL can help catch common matching problems, such as nicknames (e.g., Pam v. Pamela) or typos (e.g., John v. Jonh), without showing the rest of your identifying information. To see how MINDFIRL works with a specific example, see section 2.3.<br><br>
							<i>b.	Who will be able to see the <u>Non-identifying information</u> or health-related study data?</i><br><br>
							The researchers who are doing the main research will be able to see the non-identifying, health-related data. The main research takes place after the patient-matching process and after all identifying information has been removed from the data using the MINDFIRL software. This means that, no one can access the identifying information AND the health-related data at the same time. We will code your non-identifying information to protect your identity. <b>This allows us to use your information to make scientific or medical discoveries without knowing which information belongs to you. </b>

                            <b>Patient-matching is the process of linking records of the same real-world person from different databases.</b> Patient matching helps researchers answer difficult questions. For example, is disease treatment A better than treatment B for keeping patients healthy? To do this, we might want to count the number of emergency room visits Jane Doe made this year across several hospitals. This requires linking records from all the hospitals she visited. After patient-matching, no identifying information is needed; it is removed from the <a href="#" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted gray;font-style: italic;" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="hover" data-content="We call the health-related information that is matched to one real-world person a 'linked data record.' We call the collection of all linked data records the “linked data.”">linked data</a>.<br><br>
							Patient-matching is challenging because a universal identification number does not exist to easily link records in different systems. Instead, <b>we have to use identifying information, like first and last names, birthdates, race, and gender to decide which records belong to the same person.</b> Below is an example of what patient-matching might look like:<br><br>

                            MINDFIRL (Minimum Necessary Disclosure for Interactive Record Linkage) is a software that we use to help protect privacy in the patient matching process of our research. It protects privacy in a few ways. First, <b>it separates the identifying information from the health-related study information.</b> That way, the researchers can view <a href="#" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted gray;font-style: italic;" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Identifying information is information that helps us tell you apart from someone else.

							The image below shows how MINDFIRL works.

This is the information that will help us answer our research question.">non-identifying information</a> immediately.</b>  In this way, if a researcher sees identifying information during the patient-matching process, the researcher cannot see any other sensitive information at the same time. After the patient-matching process, MINDFIRL gives us the <a href="#" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted gray;font-style: italic;" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="hover" data-content="We call the health-related information that is matched to one real-world person a 'linked data record.'

							<i>Figure 2: This image shows how MINDFIRL helps the patient-matching process while limiting access to sensitive information. MINDFIRL uses encryption to separate identifying and non-identifying information during patient-matching and the main research.</i><br><br>
							<img src="../static/images/Fig2_new.PNG" alt="1"/><br><br>
							Second, MINDFIRL hides identifying information, while giving our researchers clues about how similar or different the same identifier is in two records. That way, <b>MINDFIRL allows our researcher to match records without seeing the specific identifying information.</b> See below.<br><br>
							<i>Figure 3: This image shows what researchers would see when they use MINFIRL during the patient-matching process. The symbols help researchers understand how similar or different the identifying information is without seeing every detail.</i><br><br>
							<img src="../static/images/Fig3.PNG" alt="1"/><br><br>
							Third, MINDFIRL allows researchers to selectively reveal information to help accurately match patients. This way, <b>a researcher does not have to see every identifier in order to make a correct match.</b> You can see how this works in this clickable demo (You must use chrome on your PC for this demo to work well.

There is always a slight chance that someone outside our research group may try to gain access to your data or that someone matching the data might misuse it. <br> <br> We work hard to minimize these risks. First, we store all data on secure computers that meet legal standards to minimize the risk of someone breaking into the data.

                            MINDFIRL is designed to improve privacy in database studies. It limits access to identifying information. It also includes tools to promote transparency and monitor researcher activity to limit risk. For example, MINDFIRL tracks what identifying information is viewed and who viewed it. This is similar to a store that has a surveillance camera to make sure that the cashier does not take money from the cash register.  This tracking tool is used to discourage the misuse of your information. It also allows for setting hard limits on how much data is used. Once this limit is reached, researchers cannot reveal more information. See figure below.<br> <br>

                            OPTION 1: Your information should help us make discoveries from this research in two ways. First, it is easier to make discoveries or find patterns if there are more records in the dataset. Second, it is important for our data to be representative of the population. If people like you are not included in the research, then what we learn will not be useful to you or others in similar situations.  In other words, without your information our findings will not be representative of you.<br><br>
							OPTION 2: In short, your information could help make any discoveries from this research more helpful to people like you. In research, we use information about a group of people, called a “sample,” to understand things about a larger group or “population.” If our data is too different from the population then we cannot learn very much from the research. If people like you are not included in the research, then what we learn will not be useful to you or others like you.  For example, if young adults are excluded from all studies about exercise, it will be difficult to know the types and varieties of exercise that are most beneficial to young adults.<b><span style="color:rgb(114, 114, 114);"> [Suggestion for researchers using this FAQ: Researchers should consider swapping this example with one that relates to the present research]</span></b> In other words, without your information it will be harder for us to understand how this research relates to people like you.
